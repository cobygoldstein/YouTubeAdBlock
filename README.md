# YouTube Ad Blocker Chrome Extension

Ad free Youtube experience!

Navigate through YouTube's ad blocker detection by embedding an ad-free version on top of the existing video player. Automatically resizes with the window and seamlessly loads future videos.

## Future Work / Todo

- **Autofocus on Embed**: We're working on implementing autofocus for newly embedded videos. This will allow key commands such as fast forward, pause, and full-screen mode to work immediately after a video loads.
- **Improved Detection**: Occasionally, a video that the API marks as embeddable isn't actually so. While a manual deactivate feature exists in the extension, our goal is to automate this detection process to enhance user experience.
